A test project created for the Kwalee interview test

Hi there,

I hope that you enjoy this game that I have made for you over my weekend :)
I do not have a MAC I am afraid, therefore I am unable to send an xCode project, or an .ipa file.
I have however also attached an .apk for use on android devices.

- The project has been created in Unity version 2019.3.7f1
- In order to play the game in editor, please tick the "Debug With Mouse" box, on the "Player" object, in both the "PlayerMotor" component and the "PlayerShooting" component.
- If building to mobile, please ensure these are both UNTICKED.

Kind Regards,
Ben Lavender
